# This repository contains teaching materials for the Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science in Edinburgh, 2025.

We will look at networks of social media interaction on Twitter/X (retweet and secondarily mention networks). This is contained in the file mp_tweet_networks.R. This code is self-contained and loads data from another Github repository. You'll need to adjust the working directory for your system and create a subfolder "results_MP_2025" within that working directory.

Additionally, if time permits we will look at reply interactions on Reddit. This is contained in the file reddit_replies_network.R. Additionally, the file reddit_utterances_preprocessing.R illustrates pre-processing steps. However, running that file requires first downloading the Reddit corpus (small) from the convokit Python module. See here: https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/reddit-small.html
